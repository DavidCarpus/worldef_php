<p>The WE Foundation is providing a solution (coconut husk briquettes) to current deforestation due to cutting of trees in the use of charcoal for heating and cooking in the country of Haiti. WEF looks to support a local Haitian organization (Konpay) to expand a proven biomass option of coconut husk briquettes, to process and deliver 500,000 coconut husk briquettes to the Haitian market. This initiative allows Konpay to add an automated briquette press, which will allow Konpay to produce 500,000 briquettes per month. The population WE plan to serve is the country of Haiti, with implications for global impact. The coconut husk briquettes emit less CO2, burn safer and easier and are cheaper for the marginalized consumer who needs energy for cooking and heating. Local Haitian women and children will have the most direct benefit, by having an alternative to unsafe use of charcoal burning in and close to the house.The WE Foundation is currently working with Joe Duplan the director and head of operations of Konpay.

<h2>FOCUS</h2>
<p>The primary mission for this project is to bring an alternative energy source for the purpose of replacing cutting and burning of trees, which are currently being used for charcoal in Haiti. Coconut husks will be collected, processed and distributed by locals, creating jobs, combating deforestation and reducing toxic emissions released into the environment. WE looks to support Konpay for the allocation of an automated briquette press, which is far more efficient than current presses being used and thereby generating a production capacity of 500,000 briquettes per month.

<h2>INITIATED</h2>
<p>The World Education Foundation began working with Konpay in September 2014 to investigate the feasibility of creating alternative energy solutions for the country of Haiti. The World Education Foundation was introduced to the project by George Garland, a senior advisor to the UN. WE traveled to Haiti to meet the founder and implementer of the project, Joe Duplan. Through Joeâ€™s organization, Konpay, he has been working to create a supply chain which will gather, process and distribute clean cookstoves and coconut briquettes to local consumers, building continued solutions to Co2 emission reduction and forest preservation throughout Haiti.
