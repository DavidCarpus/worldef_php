Nearly 80% of the participants have been able to increase their production and sell of quinine, within 3 months of entering the program. Along with saving thousands of lives from the end product, the program has created over 100 new direct or indirect jobs, in farming, pharmaceutical and transportation industries. Over 2 million trees have been planted to improve soil and water management. The project has succeeded in increasing the incomes of individuals in post-war regions, helping them improve their socio-economic sustainability.
