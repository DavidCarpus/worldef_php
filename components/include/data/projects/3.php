Through the method of participatory community engagement, the WE Foundation is working to pull thousands of farmers and families out of poverty, while improving energy needs for increased human experiences. With current fossil-diesel arriving from Mombasa, Kenya (1,531 km), this project will supply local energy production and consumption; minimizing, security, transport and surcharge demands.This program aims to create 5,000+ direct and indirect jobs in the districts of the Ruzizi Valley and Fizi Mountains in the DRC. These regions were chosen for their geographical location to logistic networks, along with the availability of marginal lands to not compete with food crops. The program will concentrate heavily to prevent Biodiesel crops competing with food crops, instead creating a closed loop system, which provides energy and food for local beneficiaries. If there is a surplus, fuels can easily be exported to neighboring countries.

The 2 proposed sites will supply the region with over 3.5 million liters of biofuel, along with create a plethora of by-products. Each participant will increase their yearly income from 5 to 8 times their current capacity.

<h2>FOCUS</h2>

The World Education Foundation is forming ‘Local Cooperatives’ for the purpose of building and operating two plant-based Biodiesel facilities in the South Kivu district of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. WE will mobilize over 5,000 farmers in the region to cultivate bio-diesel feedstock for fuel processing and by-products, increase food production, provide water and sanitation sustainability, increase nutrition intake and develop health and education benefits.

<h2>INITIATED</h2>


Initiated in 2012, WE have conducted and completed a comprehensive feasibility study, which includes insights and feedback from local and cross bordered heavy hauler and construction companies, agronomists, MONUSCO, technologists, and local community members. WE have allocated 75 hectares of land to pilot and create nursery for project development purposes near Uvira in the Ruzizi Valley. WE are currently putting together a team of engineers to create specifications for build out of bio-diesel plants.
