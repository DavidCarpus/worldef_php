The Sahel Youth Development project utilizes a human-centered design approach and participatory methods toensure that the participants become engaged and effective civic actors, along with building their capacity and understanding of the 7 pillars surrounding social responsibility and inclusion. The design approaches innovation, creativity, empowerment and youth-focused development strategies to solve personal and community problems.

<h2>FOCUS</h2>

The WE Foundation is working to coordinate youth leadership and empowerment programs throughout the Southern Sahara region, building a dedicated institution to approach civic engagement, conflict resolution, democracy, human rights, cultural sensitivity, capacity building and income generation. The programs initiated will serve as a catalyst for peacebuilding and conflict resolution, while providing the opportunity for educational development concentrated on the youth from both sides of the disputed territories.
